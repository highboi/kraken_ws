# Kraken: Edge Computing and Data Analytics Software

![Kraken Logo](https://github.com/highboi/kraken/blob/master/kraken_logo_blue.png)

Kraken is a piece of networking software that aims to bring edge computing and IoT (Internet-of-Things) to the big audience. Shifting away from the paradigm of big data for big
institutions, Kraken has the potential to increase the utilization of data across all industries. By using web technologies such as WebSockets and WebAssembly, the Kraken software
can establish an "information network" which gathers, stores, manages, and analyzes data at the edge without the need for expensive computing infrastructure changes. This software
will help industries that require physical interaction with the world especially. Kraken will be able to help scientific research, space exploration, military operations, and most
notably blue-collar automation. By enabling companies to establish a completely vertically integrated data infrastructure, dealing with complex hardware systems becomes easier as
you can write and deploy code on the network (write once, deploy everywhere). Development of the aforementioned fields will be accelerated through this ease-of-use.

# Tsunami: The P2P Web Protocol

![Tsunami Logo](https://github.com/highboi/kraken/blob/master/tsunami_logo.png)

Tsunami aims to be a web protocol for the new age. Tsunami enables anyone to establish their own "information network" by running an instance of Tsunami on a server called a "beacon".
Beacons allow for connections to be made between peers. After this, peers can manipulate data on the P2P network with a complete CRUD architecture (Create, Read, Update, Destroy).
Tsunami stores primitive data types and files similarly to torrents, fragmenting the data and distributing the data among the peer browsers using the LocalStorage API. Tsunami is
the answer to the problem of big tech, anyone can establish their own information network that scales automatically. Make a custom social network with friends, make a custom cloud
storage solution, make a networked cluster computer, do anything with P2P networks with Tsunami.
